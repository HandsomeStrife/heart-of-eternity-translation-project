The path is complete!

The path you have chosen for yourself. 

You, who were called the Lost,
you stand at the very Heart of the world. 

You saw him all... 

I saw his cruelty. 

But children are always cruel.

And yet Sarkus is still young,
isn't it, Darion? 

I saw his kindness,
for there is no darkness without light. 

Otherwise, your creation would be imperfect, wouldn't it, Siddhartha?

Now you know that a Heart beats within it. 

And this means that the world around you will live. 

Live as long as you allow him to. 

And his Heart: 

Eternity.
